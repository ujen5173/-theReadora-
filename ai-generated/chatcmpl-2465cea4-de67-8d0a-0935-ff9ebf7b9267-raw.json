It bathed him in a kind of radiance that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at the same time. He felt its warmth, its presence, its weight, and yet, he could not move. He was trapped, suspended in a kind of ethereal limbo that defied the laws of physics.\n\nHe blinked, trying to clear his vision, but the light was too bright, too pervasive. It felt as though he was drowning in it, suffocating under the sheer brilliance of it. His head throbbed, a dull ache that seemed to pulse in time with his heartbeat. His body felt heavy, leaden, as though he had been asleep for an eternity.\n\nAnd then, slowly, the light began to fade.\n\nAs it did, he became aware of his surroundings. He was lying on a soft bed, covered in a thick, warm blanket. The room around him was small, cozy, with walls made of stone and a fire crackling merrily in a hearth. The air was cool, crisp, and carried the faint scent of wood smoke and something spicy, perhaps cinnamon.\n\nHe tried to sit up, but his body protested, muscles weak and unresponsive. He groaned, the sound harsh and alien in his own ears. His throat was dry, parched, and he felt a wave of nausea as he moved.\n\nHe lay back down, panting slightly, and tried to make sense of his surroundings. He was in a bed, in a small room, in a place he did not recognize. The last thing he remembered was... what? He tried to think, but his mind was a fog, thick and impenetrable.\n\nHe closed his eyes, trying to remember, but the effort was too much. His head spun, and he felt a wave of dizziness wash over him. He groaned again, more softly this time, and let his mind drift, hoping that rest would bring clarity.\n\nWhen he opened his eyes again, the room was dim. The fire in the hearth had burned low, casting flickering shadows on the walls. The air was cooler now, and he could hear the faint sound of rain outside.\n\nHe sat up slowly, cautiously, and this time his body cooperated. He felt a little stronger, a little more in control. He looked around, taking in the details of the room. There was a small table next to the bed, a simple wooden chair, and a wardrobe in the corner. The walls were adorned with simple tapestries, their designs unfamiliar to him.\n\nHe swung his legs over the side of the bed and stood up, testing his balance. He felt a little light-headed, but otherwise steady. He took a few steps, testing his legs, and was pleased to find that he could walk without stumbling.\n\nHe made his way to the door, which was slightly ajar, and pushed it open. Beyond it lay a short corridor, dimly lit by a few flickering candles. He walked down the corridor, his steps tentative, but confident, and found himself in a larger room.\n\nThis room was clearly the main hall of the house, with a large wooden table in the center, surrounded by comfortable-looking chairs. There was a fire burning in the hearth, and the air was warm and inviting.\n\nHe heard footsteps approaching from behind, and he turned to see a woman entering the room. She was small, with a round, cheerful face and curly brown hair tied back in a messy bun. She was wearing a simple dress that looked well-worn but clean, and she carried a tray with a steaming pot and a couple of mugs.\n\n“Ah, you're awake! I was beginning to worry,” she said, her voice warm and friendly. She set the tray down on the table and rushed to his side, her hands fluttering anxiously. “How are you feeling? Do you need anything? Some water? Something to eat?”\n\nHe nodded, his throat still too dry to speak. She hurriedly poured him a mug of water and handed it to him, her eyes bright with concern.\n\nHe drank deeply, the cool water soothing his throat. He felt some of his strength returning, and his thoughts began to clear.\n\n“Thank you,” he croaked, his voice rough and unfamiliar.\n\n“Of course, dear,” she replied, smiling. “You’ve been through quite an ordeal, haven’t you? My name is Emily. I found you collapsed in the woods. You were in a bad way, but I think you’ll be alright now. You just need some rest and nourishment.”\n\nHe nodded, still too drained to say much. Emily bustled around, setting out a bowl of stew and some bread on the table. She gestured for him to sit, and he gratefully lowered himself into one of the chairs.\n\nThe stew was hearty and delicious, just the right thing to warm his body and soothe his stomach. He ate slowly, savoring each bite, and felt his strength returning with every mouthful.\n\n“Where am I?” he asked, his voice still rough but stronger.\n\nEmily paused, her spoon halfway to her mouth. She looked at him with a mixture of surprise and sympathy.\n\n“You don’t remember, do you?” she asked gently. He shook his head, and she sighed. “You’re in the village of Wrenwood, in the kingdom of Eldoria. You were found in the forest, on the edge of the village. Do you remember how you got there?”\n\nHe shook his head again, the fog in his mind only slightly less thick.\n\n“No,” he admitted. “The last thing I remember is... waking up.”\n\nEmily nodded, as though this was not entirely unexpected.\n\n“You were injured,” she said. “Badly. We thought you might not wake up. But you did, and that’s something to be grateful for. You’ll need to rest, though. You’re still weak.”\n\nHe nodded, understanding. He was in no state to leave, and he felt a twinge of guilt at the thought of being a burden on this kind woman.\n\n“Thank you,” he said again, his voice a bit stronger now. “For taking care of me.”\n\nEmily smiled, a warm, genuine smile that made him feel a little better.\n\n“It’s no trouble, dear,” she said. “You’re safe here. We’ll take care of you until you’re ready to go.”\n\nHe finished his meal and felt his eyelids growing heavy again. Emily stood up and began clearing the dishes.\n\n“You should rest,” she said. “You’ll need your strength.”\n\nHe nodded and stood up, slowly making his way back to the bedroom. He climbed into the bed, pulling the blanket up to his chin. The warmth of the fire and the soft bed lured him into a deep, peaceful sleep.\n\nAs he drifted off, he had the vaguest sense of a presence, a feeling of being watched, but it was distant and indistinct. He dismissed it as a product of his exhaustion and let himself fall asleep.\n\nWhen he woke again, the room was bright with sunlight. He sat up, feeling much stronger than the previous day. Emily was bustling around the kitchen, and he could smell the aroma of fresh bread and something savory cooking.\n\nHe swung his legs over the side of the bed and stood up, feeling a little stiff but otherwise fine. Emily turned at the sound of his movement, a warm smile spreading across her face.\n\n“Good morning,” she said, bustling towards him with a tray. “I made you some breakfast. You’re looking much better today.”\n\nHe smiled, feeling a little embarrassed by her care. He sat down at the table again and took a bite of the fresh bread. It was soft and warm, with a hint of sweetness.\n\n“Thank you,” he said, his voice stronger now. “I feel much better.”\n\nEmily nodded, pleased.\n\n“Good, good,” she said. “Now, I need to attend to some chores. You’ll stay here, yes? I’ll be back soon. The village is small, but there are some things I need to do.”\n\nHe nodded, understanding. He had no desire to leave, not yet. He needed to regain his strength and figure out what had happened to him.\n\nEmily left, and he was alone in the house. He walked around, exploring the small space. The more he moved, the more his strength returned. By the time Emily returned, he was feeling almost like his old self.\n\n“I’ve been thinking,” she said, setting down a basket of laundry. “You need to rest, but you also need to figure out what happened to you. You can’t just stay here forever.”\n\nHe nodded, feeling a bit nervous but also curious.\n\n“I know,” he said. “But I don’t remember anything. Do you know anything about me?”\n\nEmily shook her head.\n\n“No,” she said. “You were alone, unconscious, and wearing strange clothes. I’ve never seen anything like them. You have no belongings, no identification. You’re a bit of a mystery, dear.”\n\nHe sighed, feeling a bit lost.\n\n“I need to figure out who I am,” he said. “Where I came from.”\n\nEmily nodded, her expression sympathetic.\n\n“Of course,” she said. “But take your time. You’re safe here.”\n\nHe spent the rest of the day resting and trying to piece together fragments of his memory. He remembered his name, his family, his life before... before what? The details were still elusive, just out of reach.\n\nThat evening, Emily brought him a bowl of soup and sat down to talk.\n\n“You’ll need to decide what to do,” she said, her voice gentle but firm. “You can’t stay here forever. There’s a whole world out there, waiting for you.”\n\nHe nodded, feeling a mix of apprehension and excitement.\n\n“I know,” he said. “I just... I need to figure out who I am first.”\n\nEmily smiled, understanding.\n\n“Of course,” she said. “Take your time. But remember, you’re not alone. You have friends here. We’ll help you, whatever you decide.”\n\nHe nodded, feeling a bit reassured.\n\n“Thank you,” he said. “For everything.”\n\nEmily patted his hand, her smile warm and comforting.\n\n“You’re welcome, dear,” she said. “Now, get some rest. You’ll need it for the journey ahead.”\n\nHe nodded, feeling a bit more hopeful. He lay down, pulling the blanket up to his chin. The warmth of the fire and the soft bed lured him into a deep, peaceful sleep.\n\nAs he drifted off, he had the vaguest sense of a presence, a feeling of being watched, but it was distant and indistinct.

There’s a lot to do today.”\n\nHe felt a twinge of nervousness but also excitement.\n\n“What do you mean?” he asked.\n\nEmily sighed, her expression softening.\n\n“It’s time,” she said. “You’ve rested long enough. It’s time to start figuring out who you are and where you came from.”\n\nHe nodded, feeling a mix of apprehension and excitement.\n\n“I know,” he said. “I just... I need to figure out who I am first.”\n\nEmily smiled, her expression sympathetic but firm.\n\n“Of course,” she said. “But remember, you’re not alone. You have friends here.
