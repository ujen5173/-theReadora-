# Privacy & Cookie Policy

## Privacy

Readora is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.

Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data). This policy sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed, stored and disclosed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it. By visiting https://www.readora.com (the Site) or using any services offered through or associated with our Site or App (the Services), you are deemed to have accepted and consented to the practices described in this policy.

The Site contains links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates or to websites shared by other users. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies.

#### 1. Information About Us

The Site and App are owned and operated by Readora.

In general, Readora processes personal data as a Data Controller, as defined in the Directive and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Readora’s Data Protection Officer (“DPO”), who is responsible for matters relating to privacy and data protection, is Mr. E. Johnson and he can be reached at info@Readora.com. However, when a business or organisation becomes a member and is set up with their own admin panel, Readora acts as a Data Processor for any information input by the organisation, such as employee profiles.

#### 2. Data We Collect About You

#### 6.2 Parties with whom you may choose to share your information

You may choose to share any information, photographs or other content that you voluntarily submit to the Site or App either on public forums and public areas of the Site or App or within your private network (meaning other users you have invited or accepted as members of your closed network). Such data will become available and viewable by other users as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you define. To change your privacy settings on the Site or App, please visit the settings page once logged into your account. Once you have shared your content or made it public, that content may be re-shared by others.

If you choose to connect to social media networks from the our Site or App or post any of your content on our Site or App to those networks, then in accordance with your social media privacy settings, the personal information that you post, transmit, or otherwise make available on the social media platform may be viewed and/or used by other users of those networks and we have no control over such viewing and use and cannot prevent further use of such information by third parties. When you interact with us through social media networks, you acknowledge that we may access your information that is held by that account, solely in accordance with your social media privacy settings. Any links to social media are not under our control and remain solely your responsibility. You acknowledge that any information posted via social media through our Site or App, or any third party you allow to access your content, is done entirely at your own risk and that by posting to a public platform you make that information visible to third-parties who can use that information at their discretion.

You may review, modify, update, correct or remove any personal data you have submitted to the Site or App at any time. If you remove information that you posted to the Site or App, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Site, or if other users or third party APIs have copied or saved that information.

Always think carefully before disclosing personal data or other information to other users or otherwise posting personal data on the Site or App. It’s important that you’re aware that any data you choose to disclose on the Site or App may then be viewed and even used by other users (in accordance with your settings and this Privacy Policy). We do not control the contents of communications made between users (although you can make a complaint about another user by contacting us using the information provided in the Contact section below).

You must respect the privacy of others and you must not disclose any personal details about other people including your family, friends, acquaintances, or other persons that may be misleading or cause them harm or offence. It is your responsibility to obtain their prior express permission in respect of any submission of their data at any time.

#### 7. International Transfers

Any data we collect from you may be transferred to and stored at a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA) via Amazon Web Services (AWS), DigitalOcean or Google Cloud. By submitting any data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated as securely as they would be within the EEA and under the GDPR. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

You can obtain more details of the protection given to your personal data when it is transferred outside Europe by reviewing AWS, DigitalOcean and Google Cloud Privacy Policies or by contacting us as described in the Contact paragraph below.
